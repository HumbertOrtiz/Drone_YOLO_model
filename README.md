## Folder Structure
* `json_gates#/` : Contains the JSON annotations and the JPG the images we labeled.
* `Dataset_Final_Colores/`: Contains the JSON annotations used for training. This folder was created with the: convertir_a_yolo_colores.py 

* `gates_pruebas/`: Contains JPG images to prove the train.


## Scripts & Utilities 

convertir_a_yolo_colores.py: This script takes the raw images and LabelMe annotations (JSON files) and converts them into the standard YOLO format (TXT files with normalized coordinates). It also automatically splits the data into train (80%) and val (20%) sets.

If you label a new batch of images (e.g., a new folder named json_gates9), follow these steps:
1. Place the new folder inside this repository
2. Open convertir_a_yolo_colores.py
3. Add the new folder name to the source_folders list at the top of the file
4. RUn the script

train_gates.py: This script initiates the training process using the dataset generated by the conversion script. It loads the base model (yolov8n.pt) and applies the configuration from gates_dataset.yaml.
